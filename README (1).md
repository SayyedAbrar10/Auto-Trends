📊 Automobile Sales Analysis During Recession Periods
This project explores historical automobile sales data to uncover how economic recessions have impacted vehicle sales over time. Through a series of visualizations and analyses, we investigate patterns in sales performance during both recession and non-recession periods, using various economic and market indicators.

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains monthly automobile sales data along with several related economic indicators. These variables allow for a multi-faceted analysis of trends over time.

🔢 Features Included:
Date: Observation date

Recession: Binary indicator (1 = Recession, 0 = Non-Recession)

Automobile_Sales: Number of vehicles sold

GDP: Per capita GDP (USD)

Unemployment_Rate: Monthly unemployment rate

Consumer_Confidence: Synthetic index measuring consumer sentiment

Seasonality_Weight: Seasonal effect on sales

Price: Average vehicle price

Advertising_Expenditure: Amount spent on advertisements

Vehicle_Type: Category of the vehicle sold

Competition: Competitive measure (e.g., number of competitors)

Month / Year: Extracted from the Date field

🧪 Project Objectives
Visualize annual automobile sales trends across all years.

Compare vehicle type sales during recession vs non-recession periods.

Analyze how GDP, unemployment, and consumer confidence relate to sales trends.

Evaluate the effect of seasonality and advertising expenditure.

Map sales distribution across regions during recessionary periods.

🧠 Insights Gained
Sales tend to drop significantly during recession years.

Certain vehicle types (e.g., small family cars) perform better during economic downturns.

Advertising and consumer confidence have a measurable impact on sales.

High unemployment correlates with reduced vehicle purchases.
